## What is the equivalent of a View?
In "Jetpack Compose" Views are called **Composable**. They are Kotlin functions that are annotated with @Composable.
```kotlin
@Composable fun ComposableDemo(){
    Text("Hello, World")
}
```

## How to define a state?
In SwiftUI you can use the **@State** property wrapper to create a state.

```swift
//SwiftUI
@State var isActiveState = false
```

In Compose you use **mutableStateOf()**
```kotlin
//Compose
var isActiveState = mutableStateOf(false)
```

But this will only create the state. When you want to remember the value of your state in every recomposition, you have to put your state inside **remember**
```kotlin
//Compose
 val isActiveState = remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
```
           


## What is the equivalent of a ViewModifier?

```swift
//SwiftUI
struct ContentView: View {
    var body : some View {
        Text("Hello, World!").background(Color.Red).padding(100)
    }
}
```

In Compose a ViewModifier is called [Modifier](/general/modifier/). You can't directly append it to a View, you need to apply your modifier as a parameter to a Composable that expects a modifier.

```kotlin
//Compose
Text("Hello, World", modifier = Modifier.background(Color.Red).padding(100.dp))
```
