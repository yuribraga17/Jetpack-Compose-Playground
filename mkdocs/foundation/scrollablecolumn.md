# ScrollableColumn

!!! info
    This is the API of version 1.0.0-alpha02. Newer versions may have a different one


When an app has layout content that might be longer than the height of the device and that content should be vertically scrollable, then we need to use a ScrollableColumn. It's similar to a ScrollView

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ScrollableColumnExample() {
    ScrollableColumn {
        //Only one child is allowed in a ScrollableColumn
        Column {
            for (i in 0..100) {
                Text("$i Hello World!", style =(MaterialTheme.typography()).body1)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Note that a ScrollableColumn can only contain a single child element so if you need multiple things to be scrollable, you need to wrap that content into a layout as shown above.
